# AI Script Review: Bash vs. PowerShell

This repository is a portfolio project designed to showcase expertise in reviewing and improving AI-generated scripts for Bash and PowerShell. It highlights the ability to identify security risks, logical errors, and best practices in automation.

## Structure
- `bash/`: Scripts for Linux/Unix systems.
  - `file-operations/`: Deleting old logs safely.
  - `process-management/`: Safely killing processes.
- `powershell/`: Scripts for Windows systems.
  - `filesystem/`: Efficient file management.
  - `processes/`: Safe process termination.

## Evaluation Criteria
1.  **Safety**: Preventing destructive actions (e.g., `rm -rf` without checks).
2.  **Robustness**: Handling errors gracefully (e.g., file not found).
3.  **Portability**: Ensuring scripts work across different environments.
